# Grant Management Dashboard
 
## Overview
This project focuses on building a comprehensive dashboard to track the performance of grant-funded projects. It includes detailed analysis and visualizations for tracking grant amounts, fund allocations, completion percentages, success rates, and project timelines. The data is analyzed using Python, Pandas, and Seaborn/Matplotlib, and then visualized using Tableau.

## Project Features

    - Correlation between funds allocated and completion percentage or success rate.
    - Average duration of grants.
    - Fund allocation and distribution across managers and projects.

- Visualizations
    - Bar charts, area charts, and scatter plots using Seaborn/Matplotlib.
    - Interactive Tableau dashboard (link below).
