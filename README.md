# Grant Management Dashboard
 
## Overview
This project focuses on building a comprehensive dashboard to track the performance of grant-funded projects. It includes detailed analysis and visualizations for tracking grant amounts, fund allocations, completion percentages, success rates, and project timelines. The data is analyzed using Python, Pandas, and Seaborn/Matplotlib, and then visualized using Tableau.

## Field Descriptions:
- **Grant_ID:** Unique identifier for each grant.
- **Project_Name:** The name of the project being funded by the grant.
- **Grant_Amount:** The total amount of money awarded for the project.
- **Funds_Allocated:** Amount of the grant that has been allocated so far.
- **Start_Date:** When the project began.
- **End_Date:** Estimated or actual project end date.
- **Completion_Percentage:** How much of the project has been completed.
- **Key_Deliverables:** Major milestones or deliverables tied to the grant.
- **Success_Rate (%):** Estimated or actual success rate of the project (based on pre-defined KPIs).
- **Manager_Name:** The name of the project manager overseeing the grant.
